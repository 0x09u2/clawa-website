# Clawa Governance

Clawa governance defines how decisions are proposed, discussed, and adopted
as the ecosystem evolves from an early-stage project into a fully
community-governed protocol.

Governance is designed to be **progressive**, **transparent**, and **modular**.

---

## Governance Principles

- Open participation
- Rough consensus before formal voting
- Preference for off-chain discussion early
- On-chain enforcement only when necessary
- Community sovereignty over time

---

## Governance Phases

### Phase 0 — Genesis (Current)

**Status:** Active  
**Model:** Social consensus

- Governance is informal and discussion-driven
- Decisions are coordinated through:
  - GitHub (CIPs, issues, pull requests)
  - Community discussion channels
- No token-weighted or on-chain voting
- Maintainers act as stewards, not authorities

This phase prioritizes:
- Vision alignment
- Contributor formation
- Protocol design

---

### Phase 1 — Structured Governance

**Status:** Planned  
**Model:** Off-chain coordination

- Formal Clawa Improvement Proposals (CIPs)
- Defined proposal lifecycle:
  - Draft → Review → Accepted / Rejected
- Community signaling (non-binding votes, feedback)
- Clear contributor roles and responsibilities

This phase introduces:
- Predictable governance processes
- Transparency and accountability
- Shared ownership of direction

---

### Phase 2 — Hybrid Governance

**Status:** Future  
**Model:** Off-chain + on-chain

- Optional on-chain signaling or execution
- Identity and reputation via Clawist
- Delegation and working groups
- Budgeting and grants coordination

This phase balances:
- Flexibility
- Security
- Decentralized execution

---

### Phase 3 — DAO Maturity

**Status:** Aspirational  
**Model:** Fully decentralized DAO

- Community-controlled treasury
- On-chain governance execution
- Minimal trusted roles
- Long-term sustainability mechanisms

At this stage, Clawa becomes:
> A self-governing, permissionless protocol ecosystem.

---

## Decision Scope

Governance may cover:

- Protocol and infrastructure changes
- Governance process updates
- Ecosystem initiatives and grants
- Community standards and moderation

---

## Evolution

Governance itself is governed by CIPs.

This document may be updated through the
Clawa Improvement Proposal process.
