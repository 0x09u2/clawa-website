# Clawa

Clawa is an open-source, modular blockchain ecosystem focused on
decentralized governance, community ownership, and long-term sustainability.

## Overview

a single monolithic protocol. It emphasizes permissionless innovation and
community-driven decision-making.

## Core Principles

- Modular architecture
- Open-source development
- Community governance
- Long-term sustainability

## Governance

Clawa is governed through the Clawist framework and Clawa Improvement
Proposals (CIPs).
