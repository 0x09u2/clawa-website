# Clawa

**Clawa** is an open-source, modular, community-governed blockchain ecosystem.

It is designed to support long-term, permissionless collaboration through
modular infrastructure, transparent governance, and ecosystem sovereignty.

---

## Vision

Clawa aims to become a neutral, community-owned ecosystem where builders,
researchers, and contributors can develop interoperable blockchain tools,
protocols, and initiatives without centralized control.

The project emphasizes:

- Modularity over monolithic design
- Governance-first architecture
- Open participation and community ownership
- Long-term sustainability

## Core Components

### Clawa Core
Foundational specifications and shared standards defining interoperability
between Clawa modules and sub-projects.

### Clawist
The identity and governance layer of the ecosystem.
Clawist enables participation, proposals, and decentralized decision-making.

### Tooling & Modules
SDKs, libraries, and infrastructure components built around Clawa Core,
designed to be optional, composable, and extensible.

## Governance

Clawa is governed through open, community-driven processes.

Changes and improvements are proposed through
**Clawa Improvement Proposals (CIPs)**, enabling discussion, iteration,
and alignment before adoption.

Anyone may submit a CIP.
