## Summary

This proposal defines the Clawa Improvement Proposal (CIP) process.
CIPs provide a standardized, transparent, and community-driven mechanism
for proposing changes, improvements, and initiatives within the Clawa ecosystem.

---

## Motivation

As Clawa grows as a modular, open-source ecosystem, it requires a clear
and predictable governance process.

Without a formal proposal framework:
- Decision-making becomes fragmented
- Changes lack historical context
- Community coordination is weakened

The CIP process ensures:
- Open participation
- Traceable decision history
- Gradual decentralization of governance

---

## Specification

### What is a CIP?

A Clawa Improvement Proposal (CIP) is a design document that describes
a proposed change, initiative, or standard within the Clawa ecosystem.

CIPs are used to propose:
- Protocol or infrastructure changes
- Governance process updates
- Ecosystem initiatives or policies
- Meta-level process improvements

---

### CIP Types

CIPs are categorized by type:

- **CORE** — Protocol, infrastructure, or technical standards
- **GOV** — Governance rules, voting processes, DAO structures
- **ECO** — Ecosystem initiatives, grants, partnerships
- **META** — Process changes, documentation, governance mechanics

---

### CIP Lifecycle

1. **Draft**
   - Proposal is created and submitted
   - Open for discussion and feedback

2. **Review**
   - Community discussion and refinement
   - Optional signaling or informal voting

3. **Accepted**
   - Proposal approved by community consensus
   - Ready for implementation

4. **Rejected**
   - Proposal declined or withdrawn

5. **Implemented**
   - Changes executed and completed

---

## Rationale

Using GitHub-based proposals:
- Encourages transparency
- Leverages familiar open-source workflows
- Avoids premature on-chain complexity
- Keeps governance accessible in early stages

This approach aligns with successful ecosystems such as Ethereum (EIPs)
and other open-source governance models.

---

## Risks & Considerations

- Early governance is informal and non-binding
- Participation may be limited initially
- Final decision authority may evolve over time

These risks are acceptable during Clawa’s early-stage development and
can be mitigated through iteration and community growth.

---

## Implementation

- All CIPs live in the `/cips` directory of the Clawa repository
- New proposals must follow the CIP template
- Discussions occur via GitHub pull requests and issues
- Governance tooling may evolve in later phases
